# Microsoft Azure has identified an issue between the MSEE (Microsoft Enterprise Edge router) and the Service Provider where <br>
your Express Route circuit is provisioned.  An MSEE is the Microsoft Datacenter side of the network connection, which connects to the Service Provider side <br>
routers/switches that are necessary to create the network connection.  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol used to <br>
provide routing information for the traffic.  When BGP peering between two endpoints is down, traffic is not able to transit the network path.
