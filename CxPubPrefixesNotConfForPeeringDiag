# Microsoft Azure is unable to detect the Microsoft Peering prefixes intended to be advertised to Microsoft
 
## Recommended steps
We recommend to recreate the Microsoft peering and specify which public prefixes you intend to advertise to Microsoft <br>
In the Azure portal, select "All Resources" on the left-side-bar menu and then select the ExpressRoute circuit. <br>
Selecting an ExpressRoute circuit listed under "All resources" will open the ExpressRoute circuit blade. <br> 
In the "Overview" section of the blade, the ExpressRoute Essentials are shown.  <br>
