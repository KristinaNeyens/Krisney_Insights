# Microsoft Azure has identified an issue regarding the MSEE (Microsoft Enterprise Edge router).  An MSEE is the <br>
Microsoft Datacenter side of the network connection, which connects to the Gateway Manager.  This is necessary to create the <br>
network connection which permits traffic to flow.
 
## **Recommended steps**
We are actively working to resolve the issue and will update customers via portal notifications.
